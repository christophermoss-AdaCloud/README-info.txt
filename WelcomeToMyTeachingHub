\## Welcome to My Teaching Hub!

Hello! I'm Christopher, a teacher at Ada, the National College for Digital Skills in London.
This GitHub profile serves as a public repository for resources, tools, and examples that I use in my teaching.

Created in 2025, this space is intended to be a collaborative and open platform for students, fellow educators, and anyone interested in
Python, Javascript or the JAM as it's used in relation to STEAM subjects. You'll find everything from code snippets and project
templates to lecture notes and example solutions.

All content shared within these repositories is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3, unless otherwise specified,
promoting free use, modification, and distribution. I believe in the power of open-source education and hope this platform fosters a more accessible
and collaborative learning environment.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and reach out with any questions or suggestions.

All the best and keep Happy coding!
